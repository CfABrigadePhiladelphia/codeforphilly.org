# codeforphilly.org

An online focal point for civic hacking communities to share the projects they are working on and connect with each other around them.

## Requirements
The CodeForPhilly site is built on the Emergence PHP framework and engine, and requires an Emergence server to host it.

Emergence should be easy to setup on any Mac or Linux system, but the installation guide is currently only maintained for Gentoo Linux: http://emr.ge/manual/installing_gentoo

Also, ready-to-go image is available on Amazon's AMI database: https://aws.amazon.com/amis/emergence

Free unlimited Emergence hosting is also available for civic projects on-request from calfano@codeforamerica.org

## Installation from Git
-  Create an emergence site that extends 8U6kydil36bl3vlJ@skeleton.emr.ge
-  Upload contents of git repository using WebDAV client (CyberDuck is best open-source option)

## Installation via Emergence (linked child)
-  Create an emergence site that extends X31ae9rYLBPEeeJa@codeforphilly.org
