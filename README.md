# codeforphilly.org

An online focal point for civic hacking communities to share the projects they are working on and connect with each other around them.

## Requirements
The CodeForPhilly site is built on the Emergence PHP framework and engine, and requires an Emergence server to host it.

Emergence takes just a few minutes to setup on a Linux VM, and is designed to have a fresh system to itself. Once launched
it will configure services on the machine as-needed to host an instance of the CodeForPhilly site along with any other
sites, clones, or child sites. The guides for Ubuntu and Gentoo are most up-to-date: http://emr.ge/manual/installing http://emr.ge/manual/installing

Free unlimited Emergence hosting is also available for civic projects on-request from calfano@codeforamerica.org

## Installation from Git
-  Create an emergence site that extends 8U6kydil36bl3vlJ@skeleton.emr.ge
-  Upload contents of git repository using WebDAV client (CyberDuck is best open-source option)

## Installation via Emergence (linked child)
-  Create an emergence site that extends X31ae9rYLBPEeeJa@codeforphilly.org
